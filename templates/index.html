  <p class="text-center align-items-center" style="width: 70%;">A health monitoring 
    system is a system that collects, 
    stores and analyzes various health-related data such as 
    vital signs, physical activity, diet, and medication intake, 
    to provide a comprehensive view of an individual's health 
    status. It enables patients to track their health progress 
    and physicians to monitor their patients' health remotely, 
    improving the efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery. 
    The system typically includes wearable devices, mobile apps, 
    and cloud-based platforms that securely store and analyze the 
    collected data, allowing for real-time monitoring and early 
    detection of potential health issues. With the increasing 
    trend towards patient-centered healthcare, health monitoring 
    systems play a crucial role in empowering patients to take 
    control of their health and promoting better outcomes.</p>
