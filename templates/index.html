            A health monitoring system is a system that collects, stores and
            analyzes various health-related data such as vital signs, physical
            activity, diet, and medication intake, to provide a comprehensive
            view of an individual's health status. It enables patients to track
            their health progress and physicians to monitor their patients'
            health remotely, improving the efficiency and quality of healthcare
            delivery. The system typically includes wearable devices, mobile
            apps, and cloud-based platforms that securely store and analyze the
            collected data, allowing for real-time monitoring and early
            detection of potential health issues. With the increasing trend
            towards patient-centered healthcare, health monitoring systems play
            a crucial role in empowering patients to take control of their
            health and promoting better outcomes.
